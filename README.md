# ObjectDetection
Object Detection in real time videos and object detection in images. 

# Inputs  
There are two types of input that are being used in the implementation : (a) Real-time object detection in video . (b) Object Detection using Images 

# Object Detection in Real-time Video 

The purpose of this implementation is to understand how Mask R-CNN performs in real time scenarios. Object detection has become very efficient these days and real-time detection is very important in this day and age. 
Real-time detection has been implemented using OpenCv in this project. OpenCv allows the program to access the device’s first webcam and then the algorithm can be used accordingly to detect objects.

# Object Detection in Images

One of the major reasons why Mask R-CNN  is used even though algorithms like YOLO and  SSD exist is because of its ability to detect much finer objects in the detection plane.
To showcase this characteristic, a test image will be used for object detection in the implementation.
