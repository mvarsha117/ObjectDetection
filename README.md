# ObjectDetection
Object Detection in real time videos and object detection in images. 

#Inputs  
There are two types of input that are being used in the implementation : (a) Real-time object detection in video . (b) Object Detection using Images 

#Object Detection in Real-time Video 

The purpose of this implementation is to understand how Mask R-CNN performs in real time scenarios. Object detection has become very efficient these days and real-time detection is very important in this day and age. 
Real-time detection has been implemented using OpenCv in this project. OpenCv allows the program to access the deviceâ€™s first webcam and then the algorithm can be used accordingly to detect objects.

#Object Detection in Images

One of the major reasons why Mask R-CNN  is used even though algorithms like YOLO and  SSD exist is because of its ability to detect much finer objects in the detection plane.
To showcase this characteristic, a test image will be used for object detection in the implementation.
